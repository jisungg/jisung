# ECON 101B - Math Intensive
A course taken in my sophomore year.

### Table of Contents


### Course Overview
- Focus: Entire economic systems, covering economic growth, business cycles, unemployment, and inflation.
- Key Models/Theories:
    - IS-LM model, Keynesian economics, and modern microeconomic foundations.
    - Applications to business cycles, policy responses, depressions, hyperinflations, and growth disparities.
- Main Questions:
    - Should policymakers manage economic fluctuations?
    - What methods are appropriate for addressing these fluctuations?


### Course Outline
#### Measurement Issues:
1. How exactly do we measure the overall economy:
    <ol type="a">
    <li>Gross Domestic Product: measures production and income</li>
    <li>(Un)employment: measures how much labor (un)used</li>
    <li>Price level: measures the level of prices in the economy</li>
    </ol>
2. What is a *business cycle*? How do we measure it? What happens during a business cycle?

#### Model of Aggregate Demand: IS-LM
<ol type="a">
    <li>Consumption Theory: based on consumer optimization</li>
    <li>Investment Theory: based on firm optimization</li>
    <li>Government Spending: ad hoc and exogenous</li>
    <li>Money market: the central bank</li>
</ol>

#### Models of Aggregate Supply
<ol type="a">
    <li><i>Classical</i> assumptions and long-run aggregate supply</li>
    <li><i>Keynesian</i> assumptions and short-run aggregate supply</li>
</ol>

#### Business Cycle Model: Brinding together AS (Aggregate Supply) and AD (Aggregate Demand)
<ol type = "a">
    <li>The joint determination of prices, output, interest rates, and employment.</li>
    <li>Comparative statics: <i>what happens if...?</i></li>
    <li>Assessing the predictions of the model.</li>
    <li>Using the model to understand what drives the business cycle</li>
</ol>

#### What can policy-makers do about the business cycle
<ol type = "a">
    <li>Countercyclical policy in general.</li>
    <li><b><i>Fiscal policy</i></b> (i.e. government spending, borrowing, and taxes)</li>
    <li><b><i>Monetary policy</i></b> (i.e. central banks, the money supply, and interest rates)</li>
</ol>

#### Economics of complete collapse
<ol type = "a">
    <li>Theory: <i>Why might an economy fail to stabilize itself?</i></li>
    <li>Great Depression, Japan's Lost Decade, and the Great Recession</li>
    <li>Hyperinflation</li>
</ol>

#### Growth Theory and Economic Development
- *Stylized facts* about growth and development across countries.
- The *Solow* model of economic growth; applications
- *Endogenous* growth models
- Extensions: human capital, trade, institutions, geography
